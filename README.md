# Dr_Semmelweis_Handwashing_Discovery


## Description

Today we will travel in time and space.
We will be Dr. Ignaz Semmelweiss, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 who worked at the Vienna General Hospital.
Dr. Semmelweis wanted to understand why so many women in labor wards died from infant fever (ie puerperal fever).

In summary, they were done:
* Create a persuasive argument using data
* Testing how to fit histograms to identify distributions
* Using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to represent a graphical estimate of a distribution
* Using scipy and testing for statistical significance (based on p values)
* Highlighting some parts in the time series graph in Matplotib
* Add and configure Legend in Matplotlib.
* Use NumPy's .where() function to process elements depending on conditions
